# gospel-harmonizer 📖

A website for viewing and comparing parallel events from the four New Testament Gospels side by side. Ideal for students of the New Testament or just casual theology enthusiasts.

## Current Limitations

The primary limitation right now is the set of available translations within the site. I've contacted API.Bible and hope to receive access to the **NIV (New International Version)** and **ESV (English Standard Version)** in the coming weeks.
